# Movie Success Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

This study compares the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, SVR, and Linear Regression models in predicting box office patterns using four diverse datasets. The objective is to identify the most accurate model-dataset combination for box office prediction, employing accuracy score as the evaluation metric. The research provides valuable insights for enhancing the film industry by systematically analyzing model outcomes across datasets.

## Introduction:
The project explores the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting box office performances, comparing KNN, Decision Tree, SVR, and Linear Regression. The study uses carefully selected datasets, each focusing on relevant features. The results aim to improve box office prediction methods and contribute to the strategic integration of machine learning in entertainment.

## Datasets Used:
Four datasets were utilized, including Netflix Movies and TV Shows, Disney+ Movies and TV Shows, IMDB Movie Dataset, and Netflix Popular Movies Dataset. The datasets underwent thorough examination, preprocessing, and careful selection to ensure alignment with the project's goals.

## Algorithms Used:
The study employs K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Regression algorithms. Each algorithm is selected for its suitability in predicting box office conditions based on historical data.

## Result Comparison:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate model performance. The study reveals Dataset 1 as the most suitable for box office prediction, with SVR standing out as the most effective model across all datasets. The findings emphasize the importance of dataset selection and highlight SVR for enhanced accuracy in movie box office prediction.

## Conclusion:
The research concludes that careful dataset selection is crucial for accurate predictions. Dataset 1, coupled with SVR, emerges as the optimal combination for movie box office prediction, offering promising opportunities for improving predictive models in the dynamic movie industry.
